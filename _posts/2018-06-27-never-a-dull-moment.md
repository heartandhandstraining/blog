page: Never A Dull Moment!
---

Seriously! I feel so slow about getting my stuff to show up on line, but I am making progress, despite a set-back here and there. 
It is all about the learning, and if I have to redo things once-in-awhile, it just means things just get drilled into my head better. Huh! And, yes I need make advancements (and will!) in functionality of this blog, but for now I am happy with it, and it's simplicity.

I accidently deleted my user AND root privileges on my new Apache/Ubuntu server. It was late at night, and I was talkig to my husband
while doing something I found suggested online. I so wanted to fix things right then, but I decided my priority was spending time with 
my husband, no regrets. So, the next day I tried to re-establish my privileges, but I was unsuccessful and had no back-up of the server
(due to no desire to spend the extra money for that at the moment). Rather than re-installing Ubuntu, I decided to work on a front-end 
website and probably then my own, as well. [click here](https://heartandhandstraining.github.io/new-site-in-the-works/)

I have record of my processs of installing Ubuntu, so I will get back to it when I feel ready to move further ahead with my backend. 
And, this will be the third time of setting up the Ubuntu server online, but "third time is a charm!"

I thank all for their patience with me in my web works!
