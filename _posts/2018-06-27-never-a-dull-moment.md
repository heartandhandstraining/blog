page: Never A Dull Moment!
---

Seriously! I feel so slow about getting my stuff to show up on line. I have already utilized the web in SO MANY ways for several websites, and many are still very viable, including being secure link, which is THE THING of THE UTMOST importance in having a website and/or server space (that and having things backed up one way or the other, which I am generally very good at..)

I am making forward progress, despite a set-back here and there. It is all about the learning, and if I have to redo things once-in-awhile, it just means things just get drilled into my head better. Huh! And, yes I need make advancements (and will!) in functionality of this blog, but for now I am happy with it, and it's simplicity.

I accidently deleted my user AND root privileges on my new Apache/Ubuntu server. It was late at night, and I was talkig to my husband
while doing something I found suggested online. I so wanted to fix things right then, but I decided my priority was spending time with 
my husband, no regrets. So, the next day I tried to re-establish my privileges, but I was unsuccessful and had no back-up of the server
(due to no desire to spend the extra money for that at the moment). Rather than re-installing Ubuntu, I decided to work on a front-end 
website and probably then my own, as well. [click here](https://heartandhandstraining.github.io/new-site-in-the-works/)

I have record of my processs of installing Ubuntu, so I will get back to it when I feel ready to move further ahead with my backend. 
And, this will be the third time of setting up the Ubuntu server online, but "third time is a charm!"

I thank all for their patience with me in my web works!
