Wow! I learned just how significant anything after a question mark in the web browser is! That info is parameters passed
into the next page through the web browser url.

Okay... Yes, I am still working on the web, CNA class and web development, and project info posting is due... It will get done.

Cloud9 being shut done soon (just discovered that less than a week ago) is making me work harder to finish some projects up
before June 30. 

Time! Never enough time to do all that I need and want to do. BUT, I love what I do!
