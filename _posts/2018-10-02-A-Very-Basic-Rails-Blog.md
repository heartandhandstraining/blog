title: A-Very-Basic-Rails-Blog

Though I have done some basic ruby coding in the past, I have not prior to now done anything with the Rails framework, so I am going to post 
what I do in this exercise as I go.

As of today, 09/24/19, I am looking back at this post and realizing that I did not finish this post, but I did finish that rails blog only for development, ie I did not deploy it to production site. Wow! I have done blogs in so many ways, different frameworks! This blog, however, remains my favorite for posting just my own blurbs....
