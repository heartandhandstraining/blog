My git/github skills are still a bit lacking in terms of pushing my local repository to my Github repository. Hmmm! But then again, I was 
using my C9 account as if it was my local repository. I had to manually transfer, file-by-file, all my files to a Github repository. 
Whatever the case I will have to figure out why I could not merge branches and push to Github. And, I will get it figured out even as always.
