title: Cisco Networking Programmability
---

I am never cease to be amazed by the ongoing progress being made with integration of progammability with networking and the ease of 
management, time-savings, and security provided in the process. 

The hard part is that I am barely getting the basic networking down, and it feels a little like I am being left behind.
It has been hard to have eought time to learn (for a variety of reasons, at least one of which is going away, thank goodness!)! 

As a positive note, I have been doing what I can with networking. I know my programming abilities are improving as I continue those 
studies, also. I have added Python to my list, and I do know that I should be able to learn knew languages more quickly as I 
continue on my journey.
