title: Just a Little Excited

I am very happy that I have had success in using cloud 9 to take a repository from Github, locally (to Cloud 9) make changes to a 
new branch, merge and then push to the master on Github. I believe I did not merge locally on Cloud 9 before pushing to Github last 
time I performed similar action with my site repository.

This is great, since I prefer to use Cloud 9 rather than my Mac when possible. I imagine I will need to go back to the Mac as I get
further into this venture, but I really like being able to access my work from anywhere from my chrome notebook.
