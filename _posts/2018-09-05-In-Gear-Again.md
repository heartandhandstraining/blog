title: Getting Back in Gear with IT Studies
---

I am back from some fantastic and well-needed trips and am conquering a minor skin health issue which took me away from my 
studies, but I am back.

I will be going over the CCNA course (IT Security emphasis) and jumping back into some computer programming class activities. I wish I had more time to elaborate, and, hopefully, I will be able to do so in the future.

I am getting married, and there are always things to sidetrack a person from their course, but I keep moving ahead no matter how slow and how much I have to go back over material. It is all good!

Later!!!! (must get to work...)
