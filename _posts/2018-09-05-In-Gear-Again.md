post: Getting Back in Gear with IT studies

I am back from some fantastic and well-needed trips and am conquering a minor skin health issue both of which took me away from my 
studies, but I am back.

I will be going over the CCNA course as well as jumping back into some computer programming class activities. I wish I had more time
to elaborate, and, hopefully, I will be able to do so in the future.

I am getting married, and of course there are always things to sidetrack, but I keep moving ahead no matter how slow and how much I 
have to go back over material. It is all good!

Later!!!! (must get to work...)
