Hey friends!

I’m still in the early stages of launching my Web Design business, and I’m looking to build up my client list. If you know of somebody who’s in need of a custom website for their small business, would you mind giving them this website address: [heartandhandsweb.com](http://www.heartandhandsweb.com)? I have 2 available spots for clients who want my discounted launch rate. Oh, and there’s $100 in it for anyone who sends me a paying client.

:) Thanks!
