post: Oh, Gosh!
---

I am enjoying this CCNA and Virtual Machine reading becaue it is, also, spurring me to look up some names and words not defined in the manual.
History of computing is basically the resulting side searches, and silly as it sounds, it gives me "warm fuzzies" so-to-speak. Memories of
computer encounters, which mostly started with my Dad and his work, his passions. With his background at the Colorado School of Mines,
he worked in the mining industry. And, it is with my very young childhood days of being by his side in the mine offices or in his fieldwork
or with him bringing work home that I recall his passions, including that for computers, from a clunky Hewelett Packard to Texas Instruments
and IBMs, which I was, also, exposed to in highschool...

I miss those days, and I guess that is why there is always has been a spark of love in me for computer technology (even if I think the 
whole cloud thing and dependence on it is going to be society's downfall someday, and my Dad did, too, in his last days). He was quite 
certain that this is not the only time in history that we have had computer and internet technology, so much of it,and then lost it all,
falling into a dark cloud of ignorance. For some reason, though we love the knowledge behind the system, though, and its so many wonders
and capabilities!
