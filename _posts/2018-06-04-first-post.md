I believe I am really going to like this ruby-based Jekyll framework for blogging. I am working on another project at the moment, though, so I will get back to this.

I have a couple of WordPress blogs, one I closed (because it just did not suit me) and one, with an entirely different format, that I just started: https://heartandhandstraining.wordpress.com. 

I am not looking for "pretty" as a top priority in a site. I am looking for simplicity and speed, and I think that is what this will offer me once I get set-up and going on it.
