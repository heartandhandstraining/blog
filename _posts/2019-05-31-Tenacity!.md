I will NOT be defeated. Sometimes, I am just not 100% sure how my problem was fixed. I think maybe the browser stores things
that need to GO AWAY, but are hard to clear from the cache. One way or the other I get things fixed! 

Just my nature! Sometimes I think I must be totally insane! It feels good to get 'er' done even if it requires some head banging 
and hair pulling!
