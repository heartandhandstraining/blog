title: So Excited!

Wow! I am making progress on my full-stack web-development self-education journey! My virtual server is in place, and I will trudge ahead on to backend (server-side) nodejs programming.  I have been revamping my www.heartandhandstraining.com (redirected at the moment) website (a work-in-progress), as I also move ahead on learning to program the backend server at https://www.heartandhandsweb.com (for which there is a link on my main website/domain, the one I have had since 2006). The SSL (https) need was finally coming to a head (which I have dodged) with the google requirement/push for all websites to have such encryption.
