title: Similarities of Programming Languages

For anyone afraid to jump around from one programming language to another, I think [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21sD7n3M8Ew) may help lay some of that fear to rest.

[Another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lbx5OLYxTk&feature=youtu.be) I think is good for introducing Python to those familiar with other programming languages like javascript/json and
C languages, and/or Ruby.  I think this again shows that it is not as scary as it may sound to jump into Python.
