I will be taking, hopefully a fairly short detour, in taking a CCNA certification course by Neil Anderson (Flackbox). Since he is 
about holding a person accountable by providing a schedule, I chose this course to hopefully get me from point A to point B faster 
than me finding resources to study on my own (and getting sidetracked on unnecessary or useless information).

I will be back with more progress!
