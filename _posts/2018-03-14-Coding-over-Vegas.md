title: Coding over Vegas!
---

I am in Vegas hotel room working my CNA website. It is a bit of a side-track, but I believe it is worth all my past work and
future work over the long-haul in keeping it available for those who want to review and/or refresh in preparation for passing
the State Headmaster CNA exam. Having had many students in the past who have the background and/or the ability to skip the
time and money of a regular class, I will to keep this avenue open, and continue improving it over time. 

Yeah, my husband and I wandered a bit this morning here in Vegas, and we will again tonight and over the next couple of days,
but I could honestly care less about what is here in this city. I would rather sit in a classroom any day, especially if it
is computer science related right now!

Silly me, but I am having fun and never seem to have enough time to learn all I want to learn!
