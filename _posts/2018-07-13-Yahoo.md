I am still here and working on subnetting in my CCNA studies. I just solved my first subnetting problem! It rather twists
the brain a bit, but I love the challenge and will finish this before going back to programming. Somewhat of an Ugh! However, 
I know it will be overall good for all my computer studies, and will move as fast as I can to get done.

This is not easy, but it is not hard, if that makes sense. I got stalled a bit with installing some simulation applications
which, are primarily designed for Windows which can be run on Mac but not so easily. One application I know works because I have 
already completed one exercise with it. I believe the other will, too, but I had to remove an Ubuntu server that had a lot of files
on it for computer programming exercises, because this yet-unused simulation installation process seemed to indicate I had 
inadequate resources to run it. I reinstalled a minimal newer version of Ubuntu again. since the other proven application needed
it, but since this proven Cisco application was designed to be run on an earlier version of Ubuntu, I had to find what was missing
in the new Ubuntu server to run it. 

Anyway, lots of googling research and trial and error and persistence has not yet failed me! Forward I go! And, I will pop back here
from time to time.
