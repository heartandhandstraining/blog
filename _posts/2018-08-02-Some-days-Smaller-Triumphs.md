post: Some days, smaller triumphs...
---

I actually did not realize it has been a couple of weeks since my last post. It can be challenging to stay on track with life's
activities and challenges, but I am still pushing forward.

I decided to put check to make sure the Cisco routers, switches and associated equipment was functioning, since it has been nearly
a month since their purchase. I have been able to console connect to most of them with my Mac terminal and serial-usb adapter, but 
something with my Mac terminal/serial-usb connector seems to be causing access privilege issues or something. Anyway, I am confident
the devices function (which is the first priority), and that I can console in to the device screens with my Mac. I just need to solve
consistency of access to all those devices, and it seems to be on the MacBook Air end, ie not the Cisco equipment.

I am just very happy to know I can console in. I could use my husband's Windows PC to do that, but I want to be able to do all with 
my Mac laptop. Since I am happy with my online lab progress today, I am going to see if I can figure out the issue. I guess I can
download other programs to my Mac that may help, but I would prefer not to do that. Anyway.....Here we go again, tackling another
little issue!

Thanks for staying tuned!
