title: Happy with my Back-End Javascript!
---

My venture back to Colt Steele's Back Full-Stack Web Development course IS satisfying! I am solving problems in a more advanced 
fashion than initially and than Colt is displaying in his solutions. I am happy with honed googling for more elegant and precise
methods than instructor listed solution of accomplishing the goals of my coding of a project. Or, when I am working 
ahead a bit and finding errors in the instructor's code, so I google the error message and find how to fix it before the 
instructor gets to it!

Ha! Ha! It is too funny that it seems I keep saying that I love whatever programming language I am using. Maybe it is that I just
happen to accidently study the ones I like. Then again, maybe it is that the ones I have worked with all have resemblance to 'C', 
that familiarity of the tiny bit of 'C' that in high school in the early '80's. I liked and used javascript on the front-end when 
it really was not cool! I needed it and found it, and used it back then... How fast things have changed! 

I am very happy that browser language, Javascript and JQuery, has come so far! Back to it! So much to learn! Sometimes, I feel so 
far behin, but yet, I know I will never "catch-up!" It is the nature of this kind of work. There is always more to learn, more 
answers to find! Google, google, google!
