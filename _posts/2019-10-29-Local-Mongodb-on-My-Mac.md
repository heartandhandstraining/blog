title: Local-Mongodb-on-My-Mac
---

I now have mongodb on my MacBook. With some online research and a lot of persistence, I am up an running. I downloaded a zip file
of my github app with I had both development and deployment database configuration. Of course deployment database would allow me to continue working on the project, I was determined to get make sure I had a local database for continued development. 

For some reason, I must have left another process running on local port 27017, so I had to figure out how to stop that or designate another port. Either could be done according to my research, but I killed the process. 

Power outages and FREE cloud IDEs going away or being less than optimal spurred me to continue transitioning to primarily local programming on my Mac, which is why I bought the machine 2 years ago. Cloud 9 was absorbed by AWS, and free goormIDE is slow and
puts passwords at risk. And, of course, I can still work locally on my Mac, at least temporarily, without power!

I believe Spectrum throttles the internet for people, maybe must my belief, but I like that my Mac is becoming my more convenient 
machine. We did get a new Spectrum modem and went back to an old linksys router (rather than Spectrums modem/router) combo last weekend, and the Spectrum technician said our the modem/router was "fried" because of the power outages, but we were having trouble with our devices not finding our wifi network probably at least 6 month prior. The modem/router's web interface password had been changed back to the default from what I had set, and that seemed to be when the issue really started. Regardless, I am happier with this old linksys because I was able to clone the MAC address of the Ethernet-connected PC used to register the new modem, and I can see more routing info than with their previously provided system. I, also, set it up, so it cannot be accessed remotely, so I believe only I can make changes to it (locally). There are no issues with our devices finding our wifi network (manually configured password) anymore. The wifi maybe a tad slower, but really the ethernet-connected computer is the only computer of concern, and for it's purposes, the speed is great! Spectrum TV with a remote control is working as good or better than before, as well. And, I am
certainly not worried about providing anything special for visiting users that may think they need more.

Spectrum sent their router out with the tech, and he did give the company the MAC address, or some sort of device id over the phone, but we are not using it. Supposedly, with a call prior to the visit, the $5 wifi charge was to be removed if we used our own router. We will watch the bill. The tech said we should keep it in case and/or return it if needed or desired.
