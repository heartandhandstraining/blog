I attended an Cisco CyberSecurity lecture (#2 of a 3 part series), today. Now, I am watching this first lecture of that series. 
[This](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/blogs/vip-perspectives/2018/06/15/attack-vs-defence-my-role-as-a-defender) blogis written by the lecturer on Cyber Security Basics.
