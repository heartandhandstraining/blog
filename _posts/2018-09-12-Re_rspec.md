title: Putting Rspec on C9
---

In order to test files like rspec has to be added to the ubuntu machine, and I believe I got that done with the info from [previous 
  studies](https://www.keepandshare.com/doc/8219389/blog-computer-science-journey-beginnings-late-2017-early-2018-c9-learn-ide-install?i=18313).
  I actually previously started using C9 for developing code for class projects, and it is now a matter of seeing if that portion of 
  the virtual machine will work. I do believe I had it working before. Otherwise, I may have to download to my local Mac again, which 
  is probably a good relearning experience, as well.
  
  I will now work on subnetting for my CCNA class, ie try to keep doing a bit everyday in both of these learning arenas. Onward!!!!
