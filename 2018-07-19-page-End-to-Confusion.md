Solving my confusion for today is described [here](https://www.udemy.com/ccna-complete/learn/v4/questions/4391372).

Gotta keep moving... I lost a couple of days with trying to and installing 2 software programs (primarily designed for Windows) 
for the CCNA class on my MacBook Air and it's guest Ubuntu. The installations just did not quite work right no matter what fixes 
I found for the problem on Google. So, I finally talked my partner into letting me install them on his Windows computer. That was
a lickity-split piece-of-cake that should have been done from the start! Oh well! I am sure I learned some things in my beating
my head against the wall.

Later!
